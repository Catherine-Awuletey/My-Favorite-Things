              <p>
                Most of my favorite things to do are usually activities that
                help me escape reality. Watching movies happens to be one of my
                favorites. I prefer watching movies sometimes because I can
                multitask while working, cooking or engaging in any activity
                that could allow a shared attention.

                Gossip girl is my current favorite show to watch although it's
                not a movie per say. The series has been an escape for me over
                the last few weeks and I am <strong>dreading</strong> continuing
                because I'm almost at the end of the cuurent season as it's the
                season before the last :/

              <p>I love reading!</p>

              <p>
                I took a very long break from reading and got back to it last
                year. <em>Colleen Hoover</em> has got to be my absolute favorite
                author as at now! Her books always find a way of taking you out
                of this world into an entirely different one, carefully currated
                by her.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                This the first book of hers I read that drew my attention to her
                work and I have loved every other book of hers I've read after
                this.

                I can spend alll day on pinterest. I personally think I get my
                motivation from pinterest. From my career, to my business, to
                fashion. I will always go to pinterest
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I came across this post on pinterest today and I honestly cannot
                wait to be a full-time web developer

              <p>
                <strong>Prayer of course!</strong> I will pray anywhere at
                anytime, for anything. I feels like a super power sometimes
                becausse I'm in the presence of God laying my problems,getting
                answers, talking to my father without anyone noticing.<br />

                Putting ideas together, and planing towards my business is one
                thing I enjoy doing. It takes my out of this wold
                into a creative one, allowing me to explore my creativity at its
                best.
